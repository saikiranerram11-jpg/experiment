/**
 * How much of a stake's staking reward a CONFIRMED claim has already covered.
 *
 * This is the interface Phase 1's compound base consumes. The architecture requires
 * CompoundBase = principal + earned UNCLAIMED staking reward, and the chain alone cannot answer
 * which rewards a claim covered — it reports one combined number per wallet. The answer comes
 * from the per-stake components a checkpoint published, bounded by the checkpoint the user is
 * confirmed to have claimed.
 *
 * `checkpointId <= C` is a plain numeric comparison, and that is correct because settlement ids
 * are a strictly monotonic sequence allocated as previous + 1 behind an occupancy check — so
 * numeric order IS settlement order. Joining through the checkpoint table would add a lookup
 * inside Phase 1's per-stake loop for no extra guarantee.
 *
 * Team rewards are never considered: they do not compound.
