/**
 * The Phase 3 settlement executor: funds a checkpoint and publishes its root.
 *
 * Phase 3 was originally operated by hand from the contracts repository. In production the
 * backend is hosted separately and that repository does not exist beside it, so the two
 * transactions move here — signed by the same dedicated executor account as Phase 4, because the
 * contracts gate all four calls behind one on-chain role:
 *
 *   Treasury.fundRewardEpoch        Withdrawal.finalizeEpoch          (here)
 *   Treasury.fundDAORevenueEpoch    Distributor.distributeBatch       (Phase 4)
 *
 * This module can encode exactly TWO calls and no others. There is no generic send, no
 * arbitrary write, no grantRole, no adjustReserve and no upgrade path. It never decides a
 * financial number: every figure comes from the immutable checkpoint the calculation service
 * produced, whose manifest hash is recomputed here and compared before anything is signed.
