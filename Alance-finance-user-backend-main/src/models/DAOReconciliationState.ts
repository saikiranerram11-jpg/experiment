/**
 * Sequential-discovery progress for DAO contributions, one document per WALLET per deployment.
 *
 * Its ONLY job is to remember which contribution IDs have already been checked FOR THIS WALLET,
 * so a reconciliation pass fetches just the new ones instead of re-reading every id on every
 * request.
 *
 * Scoped per wallet, not per deployment, because a pass only persists rows belonging to the
 * caller. A single global cursor would let one user's read advance past another user's
 * contribution — read but never stored — leaving it undiscoverable forever.
 *
 * Explicitly NOT an activity source of truth: whether a contribution is still active is always
 * re-read from Staking.
