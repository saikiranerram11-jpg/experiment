 * A cache of Withdrawal.alreadyClaimed(wallet), and the checkpoint it resolves to.

 * Deliberately MUTABLE, and deliberately not financial truth: the chain is. Every update is
 * derived from a contract read, never from a frontend-supplied amount or a submitted
 * transaction, so a user cannot talk the backend into retiring rewards they did not claim.
 *
 * This is the watermark compounding reads, which is what lets claim detection work without
 * event logs — the configured RPC caps eth_getLogs at a 10-block range, so a log-based
 * watermark would make financial correctness depend on infrastructure we do not control.
