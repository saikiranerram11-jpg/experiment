 * staking rewards a claim covered — and compounding needs exactly that. Without these rows the
 * only available rule would be "a claim happened, so retire everything", which would destroy
 * rewards earned after the claimed checkpoint was built.
 *
 * Append-only, and each component is published EXACTLY ONCE: the unique key deliberately omits
 * checkpointId, so re-copying history into every later cumulative checkpoint is impossible.
