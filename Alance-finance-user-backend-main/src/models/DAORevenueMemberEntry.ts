/**
 * One member's immutable DAO revenue obligation for one epoch.
 *
 * Every field is immutable. Payment state lives in DAORevenuePayment so that reconciling a
 * confirmed transfer can never rewrite what was owed.
 *
 * Both addresses are stored because they play different roles. `externalEOA` is what goes into
 * `distributeBatch(epochId, users[], amounts[])` — the distributor resolves the recipient
 * itself through the wallet registry, so the executor cannot name an arbitrary address.
 * `smartWalletAddress` is where the ACF must land, and the pair is verified against
 * `walletOf(externalEOA)` before the epoch is ever marked CALCULATED.
