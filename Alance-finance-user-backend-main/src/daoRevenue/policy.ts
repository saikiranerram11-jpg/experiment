/**
 * DAO Member Revenue arithmetic. Pure, integer-only, no I/O.
 *
 * THE ECONOMIC DEFINITION
 * -----------------------
 * System revenue for DAO purposes is ONLY Self-type staking reward generated in the epoch:
 * DIRECT + BOND + DAO. Level, Rank, Global, DAO member revenue and marketing are excluded —
 * paying a share of a reward out of another reward would compound the protocol against itself.
 *
 * It measures reward GENERATED, so claiming changes nothing: a completed epoch's revenue is
 * fixed the moment Phase 1 settles it.
 *
 * WHY THE USD ROUND-TRIP IS PRESERVED
 * -----------------------------------
 * The product defines revenue in USD and weights members by recorded USDT, so the USD figures
 * are what the UI and the audit trail must show. Algebraically the price cancels
 * (ACF -> USD -> 5% -> ACF is just ACF x 5%), but the two conversions are kept explicit because
 * the member weight is genuinely in USD and marketing will later take its 1% from the same
 * SystemRevenueUSD. Both directions use the SAME frozen epoch price, so no price movement can
 * alter a settled epoch.
