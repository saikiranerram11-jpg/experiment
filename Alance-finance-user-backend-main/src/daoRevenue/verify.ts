/**
 * Read-back verification for DAO revenue rows.
 *
 * Mirrors the Phase 2/3 discipline: after persisting, every row is read back and compared field
 * by field. A divergent immutable row is REPORTED, never repaired — overwriting financial
 * history would hide the very corruption this detects.
 *
 * It exists because `insertMany(ordered: false)` cannot be trusted to report what it skipped:
 * a duplicate sets a top-level code 11000 while a validation-rejected row appears in no error
 * channel at all. The only reliable question is "what is actually in the database now".
