/**
 * Was a DAO contribution ACTIVE at a reward epoch's snapshot?
 *
 * This is the single most dangerous question in Phase 4: get it wrong and a withdrawn member is
 * paid, or an active one is skipped, for an epoch that will never recalculate.
 *
 * WHY PHASE 1 IS THE AUTHORITY
 * ----------------------------
 * `ACFDAO.isContributionActive(id)` checks three things — the linked stake is active, owned by
 * the contribution's beneficiary, and source DAO — all at LATEST. That is current state, so it
 * would retroactively void an epoch the position was active throughout, or validate one it was
 * not.
 *
 * Phase 1 already produced the historical equivalent and froze it. For every settled epoch it
 * reads each stake PINNED to that epoch's snapshot block, asserts principal, poolId, source and
 * beneficiary against that read (`assertImmutableFieldsMatch`), and writes one immutable
 * StakeRewardEntry per stake unconditionally — including withdrawn ones, marked WITHDRAWN. That
 * covers all three of the contract's conditions, verified against the chain at the right block.
 * No second historical RPC engine is needed, and none should be built.
 *
 * THE TOO_YOUNG BOUNDARY — LOCKED CORRECTION
 * ------------------------------------------
 * `ineligibleReason === "TOO_YOUNG"` means one of TWO different things in Phase 1:
 *
 *   1. the stake existed at the snapshot but was younger than one epoch, or
 *   2. the stake did not exist at the snapshot block at all.
 *
 * Phase 1 conflates them deliberately and harmlessly — both earn zero — but for DAO revenue
 * they are opposites. Case 1 is an ACTIVE contribution that should be paid; case 2 is a
 * contribution that did not yet exist and must be excluded. `Stake.stakeTimestamp`, which is
 * immutable, separates them. Treating TOO_YOUNG alone as active would pay members for epochs
 * that closed before they joined.
