/**
 * The authenticated user's DAO Member Revenue — summary and history.
 *
 * DAO Member Revenue is Phase 4's 5% share of system revenue, paid DIRECTLY in ACF to the
 * member's smart wallet. It is not Self, not Team, not part of the Withdrawal Merkle claim, not
 * subject to the claim fee, and it does not compound. The UI must keep it separate, so this is
 * a separate read model rather than a field on the reward summary.
 *
 * ONLY calculated obligations and reconciled payments count. A plain ACF transfer into the
 * wallet is not DAO revenue, so nothing here is derived from a balance or a generic ERC-20
 * movement: an amount appears as received only when a DAORevenuePaid event was reconciled
 * against the member's immutable obligation.
