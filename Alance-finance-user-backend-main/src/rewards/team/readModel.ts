/**
 * The authenticated user's EARNED Team reward breakdown, projected from Phase 2's rows.
 *
 * Deliberately not responsible for published or claimable state — that is `/rewards/summary`,
 * which reads the finalized checkpoint. This endpoint answers "what did I earn and how was it
 * worked out", which is what the Global Pool page needs.
 *
 * Every audit figure is the value Phase 2 ACTUALLY USED for that epoch, read back from the
 * immutable row. Nothing is recomputed from current chain state: a historical epoch's personal
 * coefficient was derived from stakes and a price as they were then, and re-deriving it today
 * would show a number that was never paid.
 *
 * A user with no smart wallet can still have earned Team reward — Level Income is deferred, not
 * forfeited — so this never returns zero merely because no wallet exists.
