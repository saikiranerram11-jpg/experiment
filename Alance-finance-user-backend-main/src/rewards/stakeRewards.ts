/**
 * Per-stake reward figures, projected from Phase 1's immutable rows.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT /rewards/summary
 * --------------------------------
 * `/rewards/summary` is wallet-level and mixes Self with Team. A staking card asks a different
 * question — what has THIS position earned — and answering it with the wallet total would
 * attribute Team reward, and every other stake's reward, to one card.
 *
 * Nothing is recalculated here. `rewardACF` per epoch is what Phase 1 settled, and the claimed
 * portion comes from the same `claimedSelfACFForStake` the compound base uses, so a card can
 * never disagree with the engine about what is still outstanding.
 *
 * Only epochs whose RewardEpoch is settled are counted; a half-written epoch's rows exist but
 * are not yet truth.
